/*Triple angle brackets mark a call from the host thread to the code on the device side. A kernel is
executed by an array of threads and all threads run the same code. The parameters within the triple
angle brackets are the execution confi guration, which specifies how many threads will execute the
kernel. In this example, you will run 10 GPU threads.*/
