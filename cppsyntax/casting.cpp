    // TODO dynamic cast
    // This cast is used for handling polymorphism.
    // It is primarily used to cast pointers or references to base class objects to derived class objects.
    // It checks types at runtime and is useful in situations where youâ€™re dealing with inheritance and want to ensure the cast is valid.
